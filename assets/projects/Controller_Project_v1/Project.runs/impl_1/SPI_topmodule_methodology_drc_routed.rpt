2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell URECI/state_reci[1]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) URECI/state_reci_reg[0]/CLR, URECI/state_reci_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell UTRNS/miso_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) UTRNS/miso_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell UTRNS/state_trns[1]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) UTRNS/state_trns_reg[0]/CLR, UTRNS/state_trns_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
